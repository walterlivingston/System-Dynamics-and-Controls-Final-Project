# System Dynamics and Controls Final Project
The purpose of this project was to develop an autonomous steering control system for a vehicle utilizing MATLAB. The system was tested at constant tangential 
vehicular velocity (10 and 30 m/s). The results of the vehicle positions were plotted onto the Indianapolis Motor Speedway using Google Earth.
